# EAES password manager
 
The EAES Password Manager is a secure and user-friendly password management solution developed as part of a Final Year Project. It enhances traditional password managers by integrating advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with the SECP256k1 standard, to secure the master key and user credentials. Users create accounts with hashed passwords, and their credentials are encrypted using a combination of AES-256 and ECC, ensuring robust protection. The system includes functionalities for secure user vault creation, authentication, master password management, and encrypted credential storage, providing a reliable tool for managing passwords and enhancing data security.
